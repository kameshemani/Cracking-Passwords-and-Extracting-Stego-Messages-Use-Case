Steps I went through to complete this project

1.Initially I have created a password_dict.txt file which consists
of all the 5 letter possible combinations of lower case
alphabets.

2. Then I developed a program which checks the match for
md5 hash and every five letter word in password_dict.txt

3. If it matches then the program will print the password for
respective md5 hash value.

4.Then I unzip all the three zip files using the passwords found.

5. I found DCIM_2837.png in Lmccoy.zip which contains a
watermark

6. I developed a program which will collect LSB’s from green
component of each pixel, then convert the binary values to
ascii values and store details in a file

7. I found mountain(copy).png in Cchapel.zip. Similarly I
developed a code which will collect LSB’s from red
component of each pixel, then convert the binary values to
ascii values and store details in a file

8. I found watermark notice in DCIM_2837.png from Lmccoy.zip. The
watermark notice is
“””This image is the exclusive property of Sangam Mulmi and is
protected under the United States and International Copyright
laws. Any unauthorized reproduction, manipulation, or
distribution of this image is strictly prohibited. Copyrighted ©

9. I found hidden message in mountain(copy).png from Cchapel.zip.

The hidden message is
“””Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
-- THE FRAY –“””
